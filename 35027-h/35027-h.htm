<p><span class="smcap">Only</span> a few years before <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> began his long and brilliant career
had passenger trains and a regular system of railway travelling come
into existence. In his early days it was still very much of a novelty to
undertake a journey of any length by train; a delightful uncertainty
prevailed not only as to the arrival at a given destination, but equally
as to getting away from a starting-place. Naturally, the pens and
pencils of his clever contributors were then frequently in use to
illustrate the humours of railway travel, and even down to the present
time <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has not failed to find in the railway and its
associations "a source of innocent merriment."</p>

<p>It must be admitted that some thirty years ago the pages of <span class="smcap">Punch</span>
literally teemed with biting satires on the management of our railways,
and the fact that his whole-hearted denunciations of the inefficient
service, the carelessness which resulted in frequent accidents, the
excessive charges, the inadequate accommodation, could have been allowed
to pass without numerous actions for libel, is proof of the enormous
advantages which the present generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> enjoys in this great matter of
comfortable, rapid and inexpensive transit. Where <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> in his
wrath, as voicing the opinion of the public, was wont to ridicule and
condemn the railways and all associated therewith, we to-day are as
ready, and with equal reason, to raise our voice in praise. But ridicule
is ever a stronger impulse to wit than is appreciation, and in these
later days when we are all alive to the abounding merits of our railway
system <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> has had less to say about it. If we were to cull from
his pages written in the days of his wrath we might be held guilty of
presenting a gross travesty of the conditions now obtaining. Thus it is
that in one or two cases only have we retained passages from his earlier
chronicles, such as "Rules for the Rail" and "The Third-Class
Traveller's Petition," which have some historical value as reminders
that the railway comfort of the present day presents a remarkable
contrast to the not very distant past.</p>

<p>To-day every member of the community may be regarded as a railway
traveller, so large a part does the railway play in modern life; and it
will be admitted that, with all our improvements, the element of humour
has not been eliminated from our comings and goings by train. We trust
it never may. Here, then, is a compilation of the "best things,"
literary and pictorial, that have appeared in <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch's</span> pages on the
subject, and with his cheery presence as our guard, let us set forth
upon our excursion into the Realm of Fun!</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH'S RAILWAY BOOK</h2>

<h2>RAILWAY JOKES</h2>

<center><i>As Played Daily on the Principal Lines</i></center>

<p><i>Turning Business into Pleasure.</i>&mdash;Take a traveller pressed for time,
and induce him to enter a train supposed to be in correspondence with
another train belonging to another line, and by which other train the
traveller proposes to proceed to his destination. As the first train
arrives at the junction, start off the second train <i>en route</i> for Town.
The dismay of the traveller when he finds his journey interrupted will
be, to say the least, most mirth-moving.</p>

<p><i>The Panic-stricken Passengers.</i>&mdash;Allow an express train to arrive at
the station of a rival company two hours behind its time. The travellers
will, of course, be anxious to learn the cause of the delay, and will
(again of course) receive no sort of information on the subject from
the servants of the rival company. Should there be any nervous ladies in
the train, the fun will become fast and furious.</p>

<p><i>A Lark in the Dark.</i>&mdash;Start a train ten minutes late, and gradually
lose time until it arrives in the middle of a long tunnel, and then stop
the engine. Stay where you are for half an hour, whistling and letting
off steam every now and then, to increase the excitement. Should it be
known in the train that an express is due on the line of rails already
occupied by the carriages, the humour of the situation will be greatly
improved. Before playing this joke, it will be as well to lock the
carriage-doors, and to carefully sever the cord of communication
existing (on some lines) between the passengers and the guard.</p>

<p><i>A Comical Meal.</i>&mdash;On a long journey promise that the train shall stop
at a stated station ten minutes for refreshments. Lose time in the
customary manner, and allow the train to arrive at the stated station
half an hour late. Permit the passengers to descend and to enter the
refreshment-rooms. The moment they are served, drive them back hurriedly
into the carriages with the threat that if they are not immediately
seated in their places they will be left behind. When the passengers are
once more in their compartments, the carriage-doors should be securely
locked, and the train can then remain waiting beside the platform for
three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><i>The Strange Companions.</i>&mdash;Invite ladies and gentlemen to travel in a
first-class carriage. When the compartment is a third full, over-fill it
with "merry" excursionists holding third-class tickets. The contrast
between the "merriment" of the excursionists and the disgust of the
ladies and gentlemen will be found a source of never-ending amusement.</p>

<p><i>A Wholesome Joke (added by Mr. Punch and suggested to the
Passengers).</i>&mdash;Whenever you find yourselves subjected to the "fun" of
the railway officials, write to the newspapers and obtain a summons
against the directors of the company which you believe to be in fault.
<i>Verb. sap.</i></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Interior of Third-Class Smoking Compartment. First Passenger,
apparently a small Suburban Tradesman, of a full and comfortable habit,
seated by window. To him enters a seedy but burly Stranger, in a state
of muzzy affability, with an under-suggestion of quarrelsomeness.</i></p>

<p><i>The Stranger (leaning forward mysteriously).</i> Yer saw that gentleman I
was a torkin' to as I got in? Did yer know 'oo he <i>was</i>?</p>

<p><i>First Passenger (without hauteur, but with the air of a person who
sets a certain value on his conversation).</i> Well, he didn't look much
like the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> He's a better man than <i>'im</i>! That was Brasher, the middling
weight! he giv me the orfice straight about Killivan and Smifton, <i>he</i>
did!</p>

<p><i>First P. (interested, as a lover of the Noble Art of Self Defence).</i>
Ah! did he, though?</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> He <i>did</i>; I went up to him, and I sez,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> "Excuse me," I sez,
like that, I sez, "but are you an American, or a German?"</p>

<p><i>First P. (with superiority).</i> He wouldn't like that&mdash;being taken for a
German.</p>

<p><i>The S. (solemnly).</i> Those were my very words! And he sez, "No, I'm a
Yank," and then I knoo 'oo 'e was, d'ye see? and so (<i>hazily</i>) one word
brought up another, and we got a torkin'. If I was to tell you I'd
<i>seen</i> Killivan, I should be tellin' yer a lie!</p>

<p><i>First P.</i> Well, I won't ask you to do that.</p>

<p><i>The S. (firmly).</i> Nor I wouldn't. But you've on'y to look at Smifton to
see 'e's never 'ad a smack on the 'ed. Now, there's Sulton&mdash;'e's a
<i>good</i> man, <i>'e</i> is&mdash;'e <i>is</i> a good man! Look 'ow that feller knocks
'isself about! But if I was to pass <i>my</i> opinion, it 'ud be
this&mdash;Killivan's <i>in</i> it for science, he ain't in it to <i>take</i> anything;
you may take that from me!</p>

<p><i>First P. (objecting to be treated as an</i> ingénu<i>).</i> It's not the first
time I've heard of it, by a long way.</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> Ah! and it's the truth, the Bible truth (<i>putting his hand on
First P.'s knee</i>). Now, you b'leeve what I'm a'goin' to tell yer?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<p><i>First P. (his dignity a little ruffled).</i> I will&mdash;if it's anything in
reason.</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> It's this: My opinion of Killivan and Sulton's this&mdash;Sulton
<i>brought</i> Killivan <i>out</i>. I'm on'y tellin' yer from 'earsay, like; but I
<i>know</i> this myself&mdash;one lived in 'Oxton, and the other down Bermondsey
way. 'E's got a nice little butcher's business there at this present
moment; and 'e's a mug if 'e turns it up!</p>

<p><i>First P. (axiomatically).</i> Every man's a mug who turns a good business
up.</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> Yer right! And (<i>moralising</i>) it ain't <i>all</i> 'oney with that
sort o' people, neither, I can tell yer! I dessay, now, when all's put
to the test, you're not a moneyed man&mdash;no more than I am myself?</p>

<p><i>First P. (not altogether flattered).</i> Well&mdash;that's as <i>may</i> be.</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> But I b'leeve yer to be a man o' the world, although I don't
<i>know</i> yer.</p>

<p><i>First P. (modestly).</i> I used to be in it at one time.</p>

<p><i>The S. (confidentially).</i> I'm in it <i>now</i>. I don't get my livin' by it,
though, mind yer. I'm a mechanic, I am&mdash;to a certain extent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> I've been
in America. <i>There's</i> a country now&mdash;they don't over-tax like they do
'ere!</p>

<p><i>First P. (sympathetically).</i> There you <i>'ave</i> touched a point&mdash;we're
taxed past all common sense. Why, this very tobacco I'm smoking now is
charged&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> Talkin' of terbaccer, I don't mind 'aving a pipe along with yer
myself.</p>

<p><i>First P. (handing his pouch with a happy mixture of cordiality and
condescension).</i> There you are, then.</p>

<p><i>The S. (afflicted by sudden compunction as he fills his pipe).</i> I 'ope
I'm not takin' a libbaty in askin yer?</p>

<p><i>First P.</i> Liberty? rubbish! I'm not one to make distinctions where <i>I</i>
go. I'd as soon talk to one man as I would another&mdash;you're setting your
coat alight.</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> I set fire to myself once, and I never live in 'opes of doing
so agen! It's a funny thing with me, I can smoke a cigar just as well as
I could a short pipe. I'm no lover of a cigar, if you understand me; but
I can go into company where they <i>are</i>, d'ye <i>see</i>?</p>

<p><i>First P. (shortly).</i> <i>I</i> see.</p>

<p><i>The S. (with fresh misgivings).</i> You'll excuse me if I've taken a
libbaty with yer!</p>

<p><i>First P. (with a stately air).</i> We settled all that just now.</p>

<p><i>The S. (after a scrutiny).</i> I tell yer what my idear of <i>you</i> is&mdash;that
you're a <i>Toff!</i></p>

<p><i>First P. (disclaiming this distinction a little uneasily).</i> No,
no&mdash;there's nothing of the toff about <i>me!</i></p>

<p><i>The S. (defiantly).</i> Well, you're a <i>gentleman</i>, anyway?</p>

<p><i>First P. (aphoristic, but uncomfortable).</i> We can all of us be that,
so long as we behave ourselves.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<p><i>The S. (much pleased by this sentiment).</i> Right agen! give us yer
'and&mdash;if it's not takin a libbaty. I'm one of them as can't bear to take
a libbaty with no matter 'oo. Yer know it's a real pleasure to me to be
settin' 'ere torkin' comfortably to you, without no thought of either of
us fallin' out. There's some people as wouldn't feel 'appy, not without
they was 'aving a row. Now you and me ain't <i>like</i> that!</p>

<p><i>First P. (shifting about).</i> Quite so&mdash;quite so, of course!</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> Not but what if it was to come to a row between us, I could
take <i>my</i> part!</p>

<p><i>First P. (wishing there was somebody else in the compartment).</i> I&mdash;I
hope we'll keep off that.</p>

<p><i>The S. (devoutly).</i> So do I! <i>I</i> 'ope we'll keep off o' that. But yer
never know what may bring it on&mdash;and there it is, d'ye see! You and me
might fall out without intending it. I've bin a bit of a boxer in my
day. Do you doubt my word?&mdash;if so, say it to my face!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<p><i>First P.</i> I've no wish to offend you, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> I never take a lie straight from any man, and there you 'ave me
in a word! If you're <i>bent</i> on a row, you'll find me a glutton, that's
all I can tell you!</p>

<p><i>First P. (giving himself up for lost).</i> But I'm <i>not</i> bent on a
row&mdash;qu&mdash;quite otherwise!</p>

<p><i>The S.</i> You should ha' said so afore, because, when my back's once put
<i>up</i>, I'm&mdash;'ello! we're stopping, I get out 'ere, don't I?</p>

<p><i>First P. (eagerly).</i> Yes&mdash;make haste, they don't stay long anywhere on
this line!</p>

<p><i>The S. (completely mollified).</i> Then I'll say good-bye to yer.
(<i>Tenderly.</i>) P'raps we may meet agen, some day.</p>

<p><i>First P.</i> We&mdash;we'll hope so&mdash;good day to you, wish you luck!</p>

<p><i>The S. (solemnly).</i> Lord <i>love</i> yer! (<i>Pausing at door.</i>) I 'ope you
don't think me the man to fall out with nobody. I <i>never</i> fall out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

your tickets ready."</p>

<h2>RAILWAY COMPANIONS</h2>

<center>(<i>By a Disagreeable Traveller</i>)</center>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that the railway train exercises a
sinister influence upon the human race. Persons who are tolerable&mdash;or
even welcome&mdash;in ordinary daily life, become peculiarly obnoxious so
soon as they enter the compartment of a train. No fairy prince ever
stepped into a railway train&mdash;assuming he favoured that means of
locomotion&mdash;without being transformed straightway into a Beast, and even
Beauty herself could not be distinguished from her disagreeable
sisters&mdash;in a train.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself, railway travelling invariably brings to the surface
all my worst qualities.</p>

<p>My neighbour opposite hazards some remark. I feel immediately a fit of
taciturnity coming over me, and an overpowering inclination to retreat
behind a fortification of journals and magazines. On the other hand, say
that I have exhausted my stock of railway literature&mdash;or, no remote
possibility, that the literature has exhausted me&mdash;then I make a casual
remark about the weather. The weather is not usually considered a
controversial topic: in railway trains, however, it becomes so.</p>

<p>"Rain! not a bit," says a passenger in the far corner, evidently
meditating a walking tour, and he views me suspiciously as if I were a
rain-producer.</p>

<p>"And a good thing too," remarks the man opposite. "It's wanted badly, I
tell you, sir&mdash;very badly. It's all very well for you holiday folk,"
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>And all this bad feeling because of my harmless well-intentioned remark.</p>

<p>The window is up. "Phew!... stuffy," says the man opposite. "You don't
mind, I hope, the window&mdash;eh?" "Not in the least," I say, and conceive a
deadly hatred for him. I know from experience that directly that window
is down all the winds of heaven will conspire to rush through, bearing
upon them a smoky pall. I resign myself, therefore, to possible
bronchitis and inflammation of the eye. Schoolboys, I may remark by the
way, are the worst window offenders, owing to their diabolical practice
of looking out of window in a tunnel&mdash;and, of course, <i>nothing</i> ever
happens to them. What's the use of expostulating after the compartment
is full of yellow, choking vapour. These boys should be leashed together
like dogs and conveyed in the luggage-van.</p>

<p>The window is down. "W-h-oop," coughs an elderly man. "Do you mind, sir,
that window being closed?" Polite mendacity and inward bitterness on my
part towards the individual who has converted the compartment into an
oven.</p>

<p>But there are worse companions even than these, of whom I must speak
another time.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>I have known people thoughtlessly speak well of the luncheon-basket. In
my opinion, the luncheon-basket arouses the worst passions of human
nature, and is a direct incentive to deeds of violence. To say this is
to cast an aspersion upon the refreshment contractor, who is evidently a
man of touchingly simple faith and high imagination. Simple faith
assuredly, for does he not provide on the principle that our insides are
hardy and vigorous and unspoilt by the art of cooking? High imagination
most certainly, otherwise he would never call that red fluid by the name
of claret.</p>

<p>No, it is to the social rather than to the gastronomic influence of the
luncheon-basket that I wish to advert.</p>

<p>Once I procured a luncheon-basket and with it came the demon of
discontent and suspicion, converting three neutral people into deadly
enemies.</p>

<p>One was a pale young man who had been scowling over Browning and making
frantic notes on the margin of the book. Personally, I don't think it
quite decent for pale young men to improve their minds in a public
conveyance&mdash;but at any rate he had seemed harmless. Now he raised his
eyes and viewed me with undisguised contempt. "Wretched glutton," he
said in effect, and when accidentally I burned my mouth with mustard
(which a sudden swerve had sent meandering in a yellow stream across the
chicken and ham), he gave a sneering, callous smile, which reminded me
that a man may smile and smile and be a&mdash;railway companion.</p>

<p>I verily believe that youth to be capable of any crime, even Extension
lecturing.</p>

<p>Then there was a young lady reading a sixpenny Braddon, who viewed me as
if I were some monster; when I shut my eyes and gulped off
some&mdash;er&mdash;claret, she brought biscuits and lemonade from a small bag and
refreshed herself with ostentatious simplicity, as if to say, "Look upon
<i>this</i> picture and on the wine-bibbing epicurean in the corner." An old
lady with her was more amply provided for (old ladies usually take more
care of their insides than anyone else in creation), but although she
munched sandwiches and washed them down with sherry (probably sweet,
ugh!) luxuriously, she looked with pious horror at my plates and dishes
spread out. I <i>might</i> have said, "Madam, I eat frankly and openly; my
resources may be viewed by all. Your secret and delusive bags have
limitless resources that you are ashamed to show."</p>

<p>I didn't say so; but the restraint placed on myself quite spoilt the
lunch. No more baskets.</p>

<p><i>The Eccentric Man (to the Lady of Family).</i> Sorry to disturb you, mum,

<p><i>The L. of F.</i>???!!!</p>

<p><i>The E. M. (considerately).</i> Don't trouble yourself, mum, it's of no

<p><i>The L. of F.</i> It is very possible. I have been staying with some
friends in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>The C. W.</i> It's a nice cheerful place is Shinglebeach; but
(<i>confidentially</i>) don't you think it's a very sing'ler thing that in a
place like that&mdash;a fash'nable place, too&mdash;there shouldn't be a single
'am an' beef shop?</p>

<p><i>The L. of F. (making a desperate effort to throw herself into the
question).</i> What a very extraordinary thing, to be sure! Dear, <i>dear</i>
me! No ham and beef shop!</p>

<p><i>The C. W.</i> It's so indeed, mum; and what's more, as I dare say you've
noticed for yourself, if you 'appen to want a snack o' fried fish ever
so, there isn't a place you could go to&mdash;leastways, at a moment's
notice. Now, 'ow do you explain such a thing as that?</p>

<p><i>The L. of F. (faintly).</i> I'm afraid I can't suggest any explanation.</p>

<p><i>A Sententious Man.</i> Fried fish is very sustaining.</p>

<p class="inset">[<i>Relapses into silence for the remainder of journey.</i></p>

<p><i>The Eccentric Man.</i> Talking of sustaining, I remember, when we was
kids, my father ud bring us home two pennorth o' ches'nuts, and we 'ad
'em boiled, and they'd last us days. (<i>Sentimentally.</i>) He was a kind
man, my father (<i>to the L. of F., who bows constrainedly</i>), though you
wouldn't ha' thought it, to look at him. I don't say, mind yer, that he
wasn't fond of his bit o' booze&mdash;(<i>the L. of F. looks out of

am&mdash;if you don't believe me, 'ere's the probate. (<i>Hands that document
round for inspection.</i>) That's all reg'lar enough, I 'ope. (<i>To the L.
of F.</i>) Don't give it back before you've done with it&mdash;I'm in no 'urry,
and there's good reading in it. (<i>Points out certain favourite passages
with a very dirty forefinger.</i>) Begin there&mdash;<i>that's</i> my name.</p>

<p><i>The Eccentric Man.</i> D'ye see that big 'andsome building over there?
That's the County Lunatic Asylum&mdash;where my poor wife is shut up. I went
to see her last week, I did. (<i>Relates his visit in detail to the L. of
F., who listens unwillingly.</i>) It's wonderful how many of our family
have been in that asylum from first to last. I 'ad a aunt who died
cracky; and my old mother, she's very peculiar at times. There's days
when I feel as if I was a little orf my own 'ed, so if I say anything at
all out of the way, you'll know what it is.</p>

<p class="inset">[<i>L. of F. changes carriages at the next station. In the second carriage

<p>(<i>Leans across the L. of F. and out of the window.</i>) Well, goodbye, my
girl; take care of yourself.</p>

<p><i>He.</i> All right. Well, Jenny, just one, for the last (<i>they embrace
loudly, after which the F. resumes his seat with an expression of
mingled sentiment and complacency</i>). Oh, (<i>to L. of F.</i>) if you don't

<h2>THE PORTER'S SLAM</h2>

<center>[A meeting at Manchester raised a protest against the nuisance caused by
the needlessly loud "slamming" of railway carriage doors.]</center>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The porter has a patent "slam,"</p>
<p class="i2">Which smites one like a blow,</p>
<p class="i0">And everywhere that porter comes</p>
<p class="i2">That "slam" is sure to go.</p>
<p class="i0">It strikes upon the tym-pa-num</p>
<p class="i2">Like shock of dynamite;</p>
<p class="i0">By day it nearly makes you dumb&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">It deafens you at night.</p>
<p class="i0">When startled by the patent "slam"</p>
<p class="i2">The pious "pas-sen-jare,"</p>

<p class="i0">"Depreciates the rolling stock,"</p>
<p class="i2">Well, that is rather larks!</p>
<p class="i0"><i>That's</i> not the point. The porter's slam</p>
<p class="i2">Conduces to insanity,</p>

<h2>MR. PIPS HIS DIARY</h2>

<p><i>Tuesday, July 31, 1849.</i>&mdash;Prevailed upon by my wife to carry her to
Bath, as she said, to go see her aunt Dorothy, but I know she looked
more to the pleasure of her trip than any thing else; nevertheless I do
think it necessary policy to keep in with her aunt, who is an old maid
and hath a pretty fortune; and to see what court and attention I pay her
though I do not care 2<i>d.</i> about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> her! But am mightily troubled to know
whether she hath sunk her money in an annuity, which makes me somewhat
uneasy at the charge of our journey, for what with fare, cab-hire, and
vails to Dorothy's servants for their good word, it did cost me
altogether <i>£</i>6 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> To the Great Western station in a cab, by
reason of our luggage; for my wife must needs take so many trunks and
bandboxes, as is always the way with women: or else we might have gone
there for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> less in an omnibus. Did take our places in the
first class notwithstanding the expense, preferring both the seats and
the company; and also because if any necks or limbs are broken I note it
is generally in the second and third classes. So we settled, and the
carriage-doors slammed to, and the bell rung, the train with a whistle
off like a shot, and in the carriage with me and my wife a mighty pretty
lady, a Frenchwoman, and I did begin to talk French with her, which my
wife do not well understand, and by and by did find the air too much for
her where she was sitting, and would come and take her seat between us,
I know, on purpose. So fell a reading the <i>Times</i>, till one got in at
Hanwell, who seemed to be a physician, and mighty pretty discourse with
him touching the manner of treating madmen and lunatics, which is now by
gentle management, and is a great improvement on the old plan of chains
and the whip. Also of the foulness of London for want of fit drainage,
and how it do breed cholera and typhus, as sure as rotten cheese do
mites, and of the horrid folly of making a great gutter of the river. So
to Swindon station, where the train do stop ten minutes for refreshment,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> there my wife hungry, and I too with a good appetite,
notwithstanding the discourse about London filth. So we out, and to the
refreshment-room with a crowd of passengers, all pushing, and jostling,
and trampling on each others' toes, striving which should get served
first. With much ado got a basin of soup for my wife, and for myself a
veal and ham pie, and to see me looking at my watch and taking a
mouthful by turns; and how I did gulp a glass of Guinness his stout!
Before we had half finished, the guard rang the bell, and my wife with a
start, did spill her soup over her dress, and was obliged to leave half
of it; and to think how ridiculous I looked, scampering back to the
train with my meat-pie in my mouth! To run hurry-skurry at the sound of
a bell, do seem only fit for a gang of workmen; and the bustle of
railways do destroy all the dignity of travelling; but the world
altogether is less grand, and do go faster than formerly. Off again, and
to the end of our journey, troubled at the soup on my wife's dress, but
thankful I had got my change, and not left it behind me at the Swindon
station.</p>

<h2>RULES FOR THE RAIL</h2>

<center>A REMINISCENCE OF THE BAD OLD DAYS</center>

<p>The President of the Board of Trade having sent a circular to the
railway companies with reference to making provisions for the prevention
of accidents and the enforcement of punctuality, especially in
connection with the running of excursion trains at this period of the
year, the following regulations will probably come under consideration.</p>

<p>1. In future one line will be kept (when feasible) for up trains, whilst
the other is reserved for the use of down-trains. This rule will not
apply to luggage and mineral trains, and trains inaccurately shunted on
to lines on which they (the trains) have no right to travel.</p>

<p>2. Station-masters should never permit a train to start more than forty
minutes late, except when very busy with the company's accounts.</p>

<p>3. As complaints have been made that signalmen are overworked, these officers
in future will occupy their boxes during the morning only. During the
rest of the day the boxes will be closed. That the public may suffer no
inconvenience by this arrangement, the trains will continue running by
day and by night as heretofore.</p>

<p>4. A pointsman will be expected to notice all signals and to obey them.
He will be required, before leaving his post (when on duty), to order
one of his children to look after the points during his absence. The
child he selects for this office should be at least three years old.</p>

<p>5. The driver and stoker in charge of an engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> should never sleep at
the same time unless they have taken proper precautions beforehand to
prevent an excessive consumption of the company's fuel.</p>

<p>6. When a luggage train is loading or unloading beside the platform of a
station, it will be desirable to recollect the time at which an express
is due, as unnecessary collisions cause much damage to the rolling
stock, and not unfrequently grave inconvenience to first-class
passengers.</p>

<p>7. The <i>débris</i> of a train should be removed from the rails before an
express is permitted to enter the tunnel in which an accident has taken
place. As non-compliance with this rule is likely to cause much delay to
the traffic, it should be obeyed when feasible.</p>

<p>8. As guards of excursion trains have been proved to be useless, their
places will in future be filled by surgeons. Passengers are particularly
requested to give no fees to the surgeons accompanying these trains, as
the salaries of these officials will be provided for in the prices
charged to the public for excursion tickets.</p>

<p>9. In future, contracts from surgeons and chemists will be accepted on
the same terms as those already received from refreshment caterers.</p>

<p>10. The public having frequently experienced inconvenience in having to
leave the station when requiring medical attention, in future the
waiting-rooms of the third-class passengers will be converted into
surgeries for first-class passengers. As these saloons will be fitted
with all the latest inventions in surgical instruments, a small extra
charge will be made to passengers using them.</p>

<p>11. The directors (in conclusion) fully recognising the responsibility
conferred upon them by the shareholders, if not by the public, will
expel from their body in future (as a person evidently of unsound mind)
any director convicted of travelling by any railway.</p>

<p>If you see half-a-dozen new patent leather covered basket-trunks with a
name written upon all of them, in staring white characters, accompanied
by a gigantic portmanteau and three hat-boxes, you may know that the
Honourable Lionel and Rowena Silverspoon have started on their
wedding-tour.</p>

<p>If you see a weather-beaten portmanteau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> accompanied by a neat little
trunk and a pretty little birdcage, you may know that Edwin and Angelina
Dovecot are going to Ventnor for the honeymoon.</p>

<p>If you see a big carpet-bag, accompanied by a large white umbrella and a
tin colour-box, you may know that Daub, A.R.A., is going to Brittany in
search of subjects.</p>

<p>If you see an overcrowded portmanteau, accompanied by a double-locked
despatch-box, you may know that urgent private affairs have induced
Captain Bubble (Promoter of Public Companies) to leave the City
hurriedly for Spain.</p>

<p>If you see a small bundle, accompanied by a pair of handcuffs, you may
know that urgent public affairs have induced Sergeant Smart (of the
Detective Police) to follow the same <i>route</i> taken by Captain Bubble <i>en
voyage</i> for Spain.</p>

<p>If you see twenty-four patent reversible extra waterproof holdalls, with
all the latest improvements, painted blue, green, yellow, and red, and
covered with hotel labels, accompanied by thirty-seven deal packing
cases, you may know that Colonel Jerusalem R. X. E. Squash, U.S.A., and
family are engaged in "doing" Europe.</p>

<p>If you see fifteen trunks, all more or less damaged, accompanied by an
old portmanteau and a double perambulator, you may know that Mr. and

<h2>THE ROUGH'S RAILWAY GUIDE</h2>

<p>The ready rough may always regard a third-class carriage, or indeed, any
carriage he can make his way into with or without a ticket, on the
Underground Railway as a sort of travelling Alsatia, where brutal
blackguardism finds "sanctuary."</p>

<p>The one duty of a guard&mdash;as of a watch&mdash;is to "keep time." He is not
expected to keep anything else, except tips. For instance he is not
bound to keep his temper, or to keep on the look out for roughs.</p>

<p>No one has a legal right to get into a carriage which is full, but then
a third-class carriage never is full so long as one more brawny brute
can violently force his way into it.</p>

<p>When bent upon enjoying the exceptional privileges and immunities
reserved for blackguardism by the Underground Gallios, it is only
necessary for a few hulking ruffians, big of course, and half drunk by
preference, to thrust themselves violently in some compartment
containing no less than twice its legal complement. In doing this they
will, of course, rudely trample the toes of weak women, and insolently
dislodge the hats of inoffensive men; thus paving the way pleasantly for
future operations.</p>

<p>Having squeezed themselves in somehow, they can then further indulge in
the lesser amenities of travel by puffing rank tobacco smoke in the
faces of their fellow-passengers, expectorating at large with not too
nice a reference to direction, and indulging in howling, chaff, and
horse-play of the most offensive character.</p>

<p>The addition of blasphemy, especially if there should be women and
children present, may probably provoke a mild remonstrance from some
one, and then the rough's opportunity has arrived at last.</p>

<p>To particularise the rough's rules for dealing with such an objector and
his sympathisers&mdash;if any&mdash;would be as tedious as superfluous; but the
combined arts of the low pugilist, the intoxicated wife-beater, and the
Lancashire "purler," may be called into play, with much enjoyment and
perfect safety, until the object of his wrath is beaten into
unconsciousness or kicked into convulsions. On reaching a station, the
frightened passengers may perhaps dare to appeal to the guard! That
autocratic official will of course, with much angry hustling and
holloaing, declare that <i>he</i> can't stop to interfere, <i>his</i> business
being, not to stay actual violence or prevent possible homicide, but to
"keep time," and the ruffianly scoundrels go off shouting and singing
"<i>Rule Britannia</i>" and telling their pals "what a bloomin' lark they've
had in the Hunderground."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
